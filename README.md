# Scenario

You are a web developer for the Acme Software company. You are asked to build an advanced prototype of an application that functions as a Gif browser. As the back-end doesnâ€™t exist, you are asked to use an API that exists publicly.

# Mission

Your mission is to create a single-page web application using ReactJS and connecting to the Giphy API (https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI).

# Requirements

Your project will be manually revised by an engineer according to the following requirements:

- The page should never reload.
- Provide a form to the user so they can perform a search against the database of GIP via the API.
- Show the results on the thumbnails in a logical way. A great quantity of results must load in a way that performance is taken into account.
- When you click on the thumbnail, a modal light-box must be displayed that allows the user to navigate within individual GIFS as a slideshow. The GIFS on this view must be fully animated.
- Create a user experience design very polished and refined.
- Create code in a clean, readable way, allowing normal conventions.
- The objective for you is to create your own lightbox and the slideshow app, without using a predefined one.
- Develop and test using Chrome/Chromium browser. Your work will be revised with that browser. 
- If you have any note or instructions about the exercise, please write them on the README.md
